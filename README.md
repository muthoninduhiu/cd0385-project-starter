# AutoGluon Predicting Bike Sharing Demand on Kaggle
## 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with AutoGluon
In this project, I utilized AutoGluon, an automated machine learning library, to predict bike sharing demand based on historical data available on Kaggle. Leveraging AutoGluon's powerful capabilities, I was able to quickly build and deploy accurate machine learning models without extensive manual tuning.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before diving into modeling, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This included visualizing the distribution of bike rentals over time, identifying trends and patterns, and detecting any outliers or missing values.

## 🔍 Feature Engineering
To enhance model performance, I engineered relevant features such as date-time features, weather conditions, and holiday indicators. These engineered features provided valuable information for the models to capture seasonality, weather impact, and other important factors influencing bike demand.

## 🛠️ Model Training with AutoGluon
Using AutoGluon, I trained multiple machine learning models including gradient boosting, random forest, and neural networks. AutoGluon's automated model selection and hyperparameter optimization significantly streamlined the training process, allowing me to focus more on model evaluation and interpretation.

## 📈 Model Evaluation and Deployment
After training, I evaluated the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Once satisfied with the performance, I deployed the best-performing model to make predictions on unseen data and submitted the results to Kaggle for evaluation.

## 🎯 Results and Conclusion
Overall, the project demonstrated the effectiveness of AutoGluon in simplifying the machine learning workflow and achieving competitive performance in bike sharing demand prediction tasks. By automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment, AutoGluon enabled me to focus on higher-level tasks such as feature engineering and model interpretation, ultimately accelerating the development cycle and delivering actionable insights.
